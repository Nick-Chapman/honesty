### 6502 disassembler/emulator in Haskell.

There exists already multiple 6502 emulators, including some in Haskell, but I want to code my own for the fun and challenge of it.
So far the disassember is complete. Working on the emulator...
Maybe when it's working, I will attempt a full NES.

Using the following tutorials and references:

- [obelisk.me.uk](http://www.obelisk.me.uk/6502/index.html)
- [6502.org](http://www.6502.org/tutorials/6502opcodes.html)
- [nesdev.com](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/CPU)
- [emulator101](http://www.emulator101.com)

And the `nestest` rom and log from
